# odin-tictactoe
This project was part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> Javascript curriculum.
I was instructed to recreate a simple game of Tic Tac Toe.

The game functions as: Player 1 always starts first, and if they win, Player 2 starts first, and vice versa. Winning a game or tying a game is prompted in a dialog box alongside the restart button.

<p>This project was meant to demonstrate my use of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Factory functions</li>
  <li>Use of Event Listeners</li>
  <li>Module Design Pattern</li>
</ul>

## To Be Implemented
The two boxes for player 1 and player 2 don't function right now. They are supposed to only change name for the player and display it as players are created at run time.
